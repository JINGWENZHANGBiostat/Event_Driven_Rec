# Event_Driven_Rec
This directory contains a single R script that applies our proposed blind monitoring procedure and the conventional event-driven design (fixed‑design) analysis to the Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) dataset.

The analysis pipeline consists of three major components: data preparation, the proposed method (continuous/daily monitoring), and the fixed design.

## Script Structure

The script is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Preparation**  
2. **Helper Functions** (Andersen–Gill data construction for final analysis)  
3. **Proposed Blind Monitoring Procedure** (Daily Monitoring)  
4. **Fixed Design**  
5. **Output Summary**

## Dependencies
