# Event_Driven_Rec
This directory contains a script that applies our proposed methodology and the fixed design to the CGD datasets. The script implements the complete analysis pipeline end‑to‑end, including data preparation, application of the proposed approach, and evaluation under the fixed design framework.
Overview
• Unified workflow
All code is written in one script to ensure a streamlined, reproducible workflow.
• Application of our proposal
The script implements the full procedure described in our proposal, covering data processing, model fitting, and result generation.
• Fixed design implementation
The fixed design is applied to the CGD datasets within the same script, allowing direct comparison and consistent execution.
Usage
Run the script as a standalone file to reproduce the full analysis. Comments within the script describe each step of the workflow.
